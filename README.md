## Development Process

- The development of "Boomerang Warrior" was an exercise in efficiency and adherence to advanced programming principles. Utilizing Unity 2021.3.18f1, the game was crafted within a remarkable timeframe of 30 hours, showcasing not only rapid development skills but also a deep understanding of effective game design.

- Key to this streamlined process was the strict adherence to SOLID principles, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase. These principles, combined with a strategic use of design patterns such as `Singleton`, `Observer`, `State-Machine`, `Object Pooling`, `Command` and `Facade`, allowed for a modular approach to coding and game mechanics.

- Tools like `EasySave` and `NavmeshAI` were integrated seamlessly, enhancing data management and character navigation. This not only improved the game's performance but also enriched the overall player experience.

# Technical Highlights

## Design Patterns and Architecture
- `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):` Ensured a modular and scalable codebase.
- `SOLID Principles:` Provided a foundation for a robust and maintainable code structure.
- `DRY-KISS:` Kept the codebase as simple and as non-repetitive as possible.
- `Clean Code Practices:` Ensured readability and maintainability of the code.

## Design Pattern
- `Singleton Pattern:` For managing global game states.
- `Observer Pattern:` To efficiently handle events and notifications within the game.
- `State-Machine Pattern:` For managing character states and behaviors.
- `Object Pooling Pattern:` To optimize performance, especially in rendering and managing game objects.
- `Command Pattern:` For handling character actions and inputs
- `Facade Pattern:` To simplify complex subsystem interactions, making them more manageable.
